In 1867 an Extra Series was started, intended to contain texts already printed but not in satisfactory
or readily obtainable editions; this 475 series was discontinued in 1921, and from then on all the Society's
editions, apart from the handful in the Supplementary Series described above, were listed and numbered
as part of the Original Series 1867. In all the Society has now published some 475 volumes.
